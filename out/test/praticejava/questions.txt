🔹 String Coding (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

You must be perfect here.

Reverse a String without using StringBuilder

Check if a String is a Palindrome

Count vowels & consonants in a String

Find first non-repeating character

Find duplicate characters in a String

Count frequency of each character

Remove duplicate characters

Check if two strings are anagrams

Reverse words in a sentence
👉 "I love Java" → "Java love I"

Find longest word in a sentence

2️⃣ ARRAY CODING (EVERY COMPANY)

Find largest & smallest number in an array

Reverse an array

Find second largest number

Remove duplicates from array

Find missing number in array (1 to N)

Check if array is sorted

Move zeros to end

Find intersection of two arrays

Count frequency of elements

Find pair with given sum

3️⃣ NUMBER-BASED PROGRAMS

Check Prime number

Print Prime numbers between 1–100

Fibonacci series (with & without recursion)

Factorial (iterative & recursive)

Reverse a number

Check Palindrome number

Armstrong number

Sum of digits

Count digits in number

GCD / LCM of two numbers

4️⃣ COLLECTIONS CODING (VERY IMPORTANT FOR BACKEND)
🔹 List / Set / Map

Remove duplicates from List

Sort List using:

Comparable

Comparator

Find frequency of elements using HashMap

Find key with maximum value in Map

Convert List to Set

Iterate Map using:

entrySet()

keySet()

Sort Map by value

Find duplicate elements using Set

Count word occurrences in a sentence

Difference between HashMap & ConcurrentHashMap (code example)

5️⃣ JAVA 8 CODING (VERY HOT 🔥 in 2025)
🔹 Streams & Lambda

Find even numbers using Streams

Find odd numbers using Streams

Sort a list using Streams

Find maximum & minimum using Streams

Count elements > 10 using Streams

Remove duplicates using Streams

Convert List of Strings to uppercase

Find first non-repeating character using Streams

Group elements using Collectors.groupingBy()

Find second highest number using Streams

6️⃣ OOPS-BASED CODING QUESTIONS

Implement Inheritance with example

Method Overriding example

Runtime Polymorphism program

Abstract class vs Interface (code)

Multiple inheritance using Interface

Encapsulation example (private variables + getters/setters)

Immutable class implementation

Singleton class (Thread-safe)

Constructor chaining

this vs super (code)

7️⃣ EXCEPTION HANDLING CODING

Custom Exception program

Difference between throw and throws (code)

Checked vs Unchecked exception

Try-Catch-Finally example

Multiple catch blocks

Exception propagation example

8️⃣ MULTI-THREADING (IMPORTANT FOR BACKEND)

Create thread using:

Thread

Runnable

Synchronization example

Deadlock example

volatile keyword example

Producer-Consumer problem

Difference between sleep() and wait()

Thread-safe Singleton

9️⃣ FILE HANDLING / IO CODING

Read data from file

Write data into file

Count number of words in file

Copy content from one file to another

Difference between FileReader & BufferedReader

🔟 SQL + BACKEND LOGIC CODING (VERY COMMON)

They may ask Java + SQL logic:

Write Java code to fetch data from DB using JDBC

Insert record using PreparedStatement

Explain SQL query logic in Java code

Pagination logic

Validate duplicate records before insert

1️⃣1️⃣ SPRING / BACKEND-STYLE CODING

(Not heavy coding, but logic-based)

Service → Repository → Controller flow

DTO vs Entity mapping

Exception handling using @ControllerAdvice

Validation using @NotNull, @Size

REST API CRUD flow logic
